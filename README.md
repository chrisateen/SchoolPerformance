# SchoolPerformance
A website created as part of my MSc Computer Science dissertation using ASP.NET Core 3.1

The purpose of this project is to build a web application that enables a schoolâ€™s 2019 KS4 results to be viewed in relation to the number of pupils a school has from a disadvantaged social economic background.

A running version of the web application can be viewed at https://schoolperformance.azurewebsites.net/

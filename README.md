# School Performance Website
A website created as part of my MSc Computer Science dissertation using ASP.NET Core 3.1

The purpose of this project was to build a web application that enables a schoolâ€™s results to be viewed in relation to the number of pupils a school has from a disadvantaged social economic background. Something that is not clearly done on the offical DfE school performance wsebsite.

The website displays 2019 KS4 results for all schools in England. Data was obtained from the DfE.

A running version of the web application can be viewed at https://schoolperformance.azurewebsites.net/
